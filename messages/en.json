    "description1": "The Adriatic coast is approx. 35 km away and there are several beaches with parasols and sun loungers. To the south, just outside Ancona, is the Monte Conero National Park. This park is close to one of the most beautiful coasts of the Adriatic. Over 20 km you will find bays with pebble beaches such as Porto Novo, Sirolo and Numana, where you can swim, sunbathe and taste the delicious fresh seafood. Senigallia, north of Ancona, is known for its long sandy beaches. \n About 10 km from Cupramontana is Lake Castreccioni, also known as Lake Cingoli. Here you can swim, rent a pedal boat or a canoe. In Apiro, a village about 8 km from Cupramontana, you will find the Eldorado water park. Only open in summer, but there is plenty of entertainment with music and dancing every day and the park has several water slides, including the highest in Europe.",

    "text": "In the heart of the Marche region (Le Marche), our lovingly renovated manor house dating back to 1850 is located directly on the hill of Cupramontana. It is surrounded by a well-tended 5,000 square meter garden with olive trees, figs and many other fruits and herbs.\n We have made a point of preserving old materials as far as possible, but without sacrificing modern amenities - come in and feel at home. Enjoy the breathtaking panoramic view of the surrounding countryside. The newly designed outdoor area with infinity pool (5x10m), a covered lounge area, outdoor shower, table football and plenty of sun loungers round off the offer.\n Here you can relax and unwind.\n\n The Marche region (Le Marche) is a beautiful hilly and mountainous region that is still relatively undiscovered by tourists. Nevertheless, the property is only 30 minutes from Ancona airport. Here you can spend your vacation stress-free and enjoy everything the region has to offer, from the wonderful food and the famous Verdicchio wine to the warmth and friendliness of the people, the culture, the nature and the fabulous 'blue flag' beaches along the Adriatic coast.\n We hope to welcome you to this paradise."
