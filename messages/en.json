    "text": "In the heart of Le Marche region our recently renovated and restored farmhouse sits just below the Hilltop of Cupramontana. From here you can relax and take in the breathtaking and panoramic views over the surrounding countryside. The region of Le Marche is a beautiful hilly and mountainous region and still relatively undiscovered by tourists, but yet it is only 30 minutes away from Ancona Airport. Here you can spend your holiday without stress and enjoy everything the region has to offer, from the wonderful food and famous Verdicchio wine, the warmth and friendliness of the people, the culture, nature and fabulous blue-flag beaches along the Adriatic Coast. We hope to welcome you to this paradise!"
