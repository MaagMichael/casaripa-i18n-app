    "description1": "The Adriatic coast is approx. 35 km away and there are several beaches with parasols and sun loungers. To the south, just outside Ancona, is the Monte Conero National Park. This park is close to one of the most beautiful coasts of the Adriatic. Over 20 km you will find bays with pebble beaches such as Porto Novo, Sirolo and Numana, where you can swim, sunbathe and taste the delicious fresh seafood. Senigallia, north of Ancona, is known for its long sandy beaches. \n About 10 km from Cupramontana is Lake Castreccioni, also known as Lake Cingoli. Here you can swim, rent a pedal boat or a canoe. In Apiro, a village about 8 km from Cupramontana, you will find the Eldorado water park. Only open in summer, but there is plenty of entertainment with music and dancing every day and the park has several water slides, including the highest in Europe.",

The restored Abbey of Beato Angelo was built in the 12th century. \nAnother historic villages in the area are Staffolo and Cingoli. Cingoli is also known as the 'Balcony of the Marche' due to its panoramic view over the Marche region to the coast.
